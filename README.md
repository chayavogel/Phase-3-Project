# Phase 3 CLI+ORM Project
## The Solar System: A Relationship between Planets and their Moons

## Description

This is a CLI application. 

After running the cli.py file in the terminal, the user is presented with leveled menus, allowing them to interact with information about planets and their moons.
The user can submit planets to database, view lists of planets and moons, and perform other actions. Most importantly, the user can enter a planet to view its moons, and enter a moon to view its parent planet.
If the user's entry results in a error, a descriptive error response is displayed.

## Setting up the Application on your Machine

Fork the Repository:
Fork the repository on GitHub.

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
Command: git clone git@github.com:chayavogel/Phase-3-Project.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Command: cd Phase-3-Project

Install Dependencies:
Create a virtual environment and install the project dependencies.
Command: pipenv install

Activate the Virtual Environment:
Command: pipenv shell

Run the CLI Application:
Command: python my_cli_app.py

You may now navigate the menu!

## Generating Your CLI

A CLI is, simply put, an interactive script and prompts the user and performs
operations based on user input.

The project template has a sample CLI in `lib/cli.py` that looks like this:

```py
# lib/cli.py

from helpers import (
    exit_program,
    helper_1
)


def main():
    while True:
        menu()
        choice = input("> ")
        if choice == "0":
            exit_program()
        elif choice == "1":
            helper_1()
        else:
            print("Invalid choice")


def menu():
    print("Please select an option:")
    print("0. Exit the program")
    print("1. Some useful function")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The helper functions are located in `lib/helpers.py`:

```py
# lib/helpers.py

def helper_1():
    print("Performing useful function#1.")


def exit_program():
    print("Goodbye!")
    exit()
```

You can run the template CLI with `python lib/cli.py`, or include the shebang
and make it executable with `chmod +x`. The template CLI will ask for input, do
some work, and accomplish some sort of task.

Past that, CLIs can be whatever you'd like, as long as you follow the project
requirements.

Of course, you will update `lib/cli.py` with prompts that are appropriate for
your application, and you will update `lib/helpers.py` to replace `helper_1()`
with a useful function based on the specific problem domain you decide to
implement, along with adding other helper functions to the module.

In the `lib/models` folder, you should rename `model_1.py` with the name of a
data model class from your specific problem domain, and add other classes to the
folder as needed. The file `lib/models/__init__.py` has been initialized to
create the necessary database constants. You need to add import statements to
the various data model classes in order to use the database constants.

You are also welcome to implement a different module and directory structure.
However, your project should be well organized, modular, and follow the design
principal of separation of concerns, which means you should separate code
related to:

- User interface
- Data persistence
- Problem domain rules and logic

## Updating README.md

`README.md` is a Markdown file that should describe your project. You will
replace the contents of this `README.md` file with a description of **your**
actual project.

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering
curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've
ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the
cheat sheet in this assignments's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

### What Goes into a README?

This README serves as a template. Replace the contents of this file to describe
the important files in your project and describe what they do. Each Python file
that you edit should get at least a paragraph, and each function should be
described with a sentence or two.

Describe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of detail. The rest
should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably functions next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.

## Conclusion

A lot of work goes into a good CLI, but it all relies on concepts that you've
practiced quite a bit by now. Hopefully this template and guide will get you off
to a good start with your Phase 3 Project.

Happy coding!
